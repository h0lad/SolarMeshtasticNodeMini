# What is this thing?

This is a miniaturized version of the [SolarMeshtasticNode](https://github.com/h0lad/SolarMeshtasticNode).

Specs are the same - with following things removed:
 - 18650 LiPo case
 - ADC circuit for VBUS
 - LEDs 

It's fully Meshtastic and Meshcore compatible.

## Physical size

37mm x 47mm

It should *theoretically* fit into this [AliExpress Box: 83x58x34](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005005480970197.html) with a little bit of spare space for a through-hole SMA<->U.FL connector.

## Hardware Verification

PCB not tested - but inherited from tested SolarMeshtasticNode.
